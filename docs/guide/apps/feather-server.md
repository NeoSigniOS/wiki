# Signing with Feather (Server method)
## Steps
1. Open Feather
2. In Server and SSL, set "Installation Type" to "Semi Local."
3. In Certificates, select your `.p12` certificate and provisioning file, then enter your password.

Congratulations, you're done!
## Signing apps
Feather is fully compatible with [AltStore Sources](https://faq.altstore.io/developers/make-a-source) (or AltSources) which allow you to view, install, and update apps easily.
To sideload an app, follow the following steps:
1. Import your app to Library, either from an AltSource (download button in Sources) or an IPA using Files or a download URL (plus icon in Library)
2. After importing your app to Library, tap "Sign" next to your app and modify any features you wish (Caution, modifying certain fields may render your app unusable)
3. Tap "Start Signing"
4. Once the word "Ready" appears, tap "Open", then "Install"
5. Once the word "Completed" appears, your app should appear on your home screen (may take a little longer to load based on app size).
