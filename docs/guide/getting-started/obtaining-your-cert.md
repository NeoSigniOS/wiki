## Obtaining a Certificate

If you have money to burn, it is recommended to get a certificate from the SideStore discord, they are a little more expensive but support the sideloading community.

For NeoSign users, navigate to the purchase channel in the [NeoSign discord](https://discord.neosign.dev) and open a ticket to purchase your certificate with the UDIDs of any devices you want. Once the purchase is approved, you can customize your cert's entitlements at [https://developer.neosign.dev/](https://developer.neosign.dev) (only pick the ones you need or it will break), then open a ticket in the support channel to get your custom cert!
Once you have recieved the email with your cert, proceed to [download a signer app](/guide/getting-started/downloading-signing-apps)!
