# Enabling JIT
## Prerequisites
Download [StikDebug](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/stikdebug/id6744045754) from the Apple App Store, and ensure you have sideloaded your apps with the necessary entitlements and enabled developer mode.
Open StikDebug to set up your file structure and allow the VPN.
## Create a pairing file
Follow the instructions [here](/guide/guides/pairing-file) to generate and import a pairing file.
## Enabling JIT
With your pairing file imported, restart your app while on Wi-Fi to mount the DDI.
Now, to enable JIT, simply open StikDebug, tap "Attach Debugger", and select the app you want to enable JIT for! (With VPN enabled and on Wi-Fi or Airplane Mode)
